        <h1>Google Chrome's New Protection Against Cookie-Stealing</h1>
        <sup>1712246400</sup>
        <hr>

        <p>Google recently <a alt="Chromium Blog Post About DBSC" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/04/fighting-cookie-theft-using-device.html">announced</a> 
            a new defense against cookie-stealing attacks called Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC). The project is 
            being publicly developed on <a alt="GitHub for DBSC" href="https://github.com/WICG/dbsc">GitHub</a>.</p>

        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p>DBSC attempts to bind session cookies to the device it was originally for. Effectively making the cookie useless, in theory, to 
            attackers. It would use a device-bound key pair, where the private key is stored on the device and a public key is sent to
            the server. The server then uses the public key to verify that the device has possession of the key.</p>

        <h3>Taking a Deeper Dive</h3>
        <h4>The Problem with Cookies</h4>
        <p>Right now, cookies can be exfiltrated from a device with malware or social engineering and be used for hijacking the user's 
            session. If you have kid's that had their Roblox account hacked, they were likely a victim of of this

        <p>Your best protection against cookie-stealing is to be safe on the internet by not downloading unknown files or sending your 
            browser's data to anyone online (even if they promise free Robux).</p>
